### What It Does:
1. **Imports `random`**: This module is used to generate random responses from a predefined list.
   
2. **Defines `magic_8_ball()` function**:
   - **`responses`**: A list containing various responses that mimic the vague and mysterious answers typically associated with a Magic 8-Ball.
   - **`question`**: Prompts the user to input a question for the Magic 8-Ball.
   - **`response`**: Uses `random.choice()` to randomly select one response from the `responses` list.
   - **Prints** the selected response.

3. **Main Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
   - Calls the `magic_8_ball()` function to start the Magic 8-Ball simulation when the script is run.

### How to Use It:
1. **Run the Script**:
   - Save the script with a `.py` extension (e.g., `magic_8_ball.py`).
   - Execute the script using a Python interpreter (`python magic_8_ball.py`).

2. **Interact with the Magic 8-Ball**:
   - When prompted, enter your question for the Magic 8-Ball and press Enter.
   - The script will randomly select a response from the `responses` list and print it.

### Example Usage:
```
$ python magic_8_ball.py
Ask the magic 8 ball a question: Will I get a promotion this year?
Outcome unknown.
```

### Setting Up:
No special setup is needed beyond having Python installed on your system. The script uses basic input/output functions and standard Python libraries.

### Customization:
- You can customize the `responses` list to add your own answers or modify existing ones to suit your preferences.
- You can enhance the script by adding error handling for user input or incorporating additional functionalities, such as logging questions and responses.

This Magic 8-Ball simulation is a fun and simple example of using Python's random module and basic input/output operations.
